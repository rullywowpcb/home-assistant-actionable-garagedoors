## Quick excerpt of my  Home Assistant config for Actionable Notifications on my "Virtual" Garage Doors

- Highly recommended to setup some Config/Helper Tools/Input Booleans to play around with until you got it dialed in
- I setup two input booleans to play around with until I actually got it working
- Also make use of the "Developer Tools/Events/Listen To Events" in order to listen to mobile_app_notification_action to see if you get a response from pushing the button on your mobile device
